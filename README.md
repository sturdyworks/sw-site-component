> Sturdyworks Web-site Component (AngularJS Directive) seed

## Purpose

This project focuses on creating an Angular web-site component, and uses [generator-ng-poly](https://github.com/dustinspecker/generator-ng-poly) for organizing Angular components by feature (home, about, video player, etc.) instead of by type (controller, service, directive, etc.) to encourage the development of self-contained, reusable components.

**Polymer is just an added feature, but it isn't required to utilize the generator.**
